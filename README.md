# Tic-Tac-Toe-By-Swastik-Bajpai

Hello Everyone! This is my first game on website! I tried my best to make it, the files are in the repo. I used HTML, CSS and JS to make it. I am a beginner so I wasn't able to make it myself obviously so I took help for backend from a video.

I tried to make front end of my own but I didn't want to mess the things up, so I did some minor changes to the front end, hope you like it!
Also if you want to make any changes you are free to do so! If any bugs are there please report them to me and fix it I would love to learn from my mistakes.

If this game was good please star the repo ;p
